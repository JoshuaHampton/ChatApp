# React + Vite ChatApp

This is a chat application built with React and Vite.
It was made in Google's Project IDX.
Project  IDX is a web based IDE based on VS Code and Gemini

This App also makes use of [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) for it's interface. 

Currently, these official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Stated Goal
My goal here is to make a chat bot that facilitates the telling of a story. I want it to leverage chat on the right side of the screen and display an image based on what is being talked about on the left. 

### First Steps
Using a [LinkedIn Learning Coarse](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=87991818&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fbuilding-a-react-project-with-google-bard-and-the-palm2-api%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DTp3TS9WKTU6bzzM5c9%252BBMQ%253D%253D) I'm going thru, I want to make a chatbot. I want to heavily leverage IDX and it's documentation using tools I'm already familiar with (e.g. Material UI, React.js, etc.) as to better understand this IDE.

### Next Steps
Once I've finished the chatbot, I want to leverage AI again for Image Generation as well. While the chatbot remains active on the right of the screen I want an AI tool to also take the responses and generate an image based on them. That way when you tell a story with the chatbot, the Image will help immerse you into the story.

### Reaching It's Final Form
My long-term goal for this application would be to someday make it into an AI driven chat that would function as a IP distinct homage to the classic GM-less RPG system called [Path to Glory](https://archive.org/search?query=subject%3A%22PathToVictory%22), published by Black Library in 2011. I love these books, and I love their RPG spin on the "choose-your-own-adventure" book genre. This would in no way seek to replace them, just be a fan-made parody used to help me learn these API's and Toolsets.
